# The Simple Shell Project

Now the question

## What is a Simple Shell? And more importantly what is *OUR* Simple Shell?

A simple shell "simply" is a way for a user to interact with the UNIX system and and execute commands.

Usually a terminal thats pre-installed comes with a shell, but as that one was created, We can create one too and so we __HAVE__.

# What our Simply Shell is capable of

As of now our Shell...

* Prompting the user
	The shell will initalize with the prompt "$" and will execute "*simply"* any built-in command that exists in shell.
	If it fails it will free the memory of the input and flush out the nonsense, returning a "$" ready for another input.
